# Big Lab I

First BigLab to develop the front-end for a web-based task manager using React. 

* **First week:** started setting up the front-end for the task manager using the React-enabled version of Bootstrap. static page, not implemented any user action.

* **Second week:** re-structured the web-based task manager to exploit the component- based approach of the React framework. Specifically, divided the application into different components, and you identified the state and props required to store and visualize tasks, starting from the tasks data structure.

* **Third week:** implemented the filters (i.e., important, today, next 7 days, private), and added the possibility to create and add new tasks.

* **Fourth week:** restructured the application to use routes for supporting multiple “pages”, e.g., by developing a different route for each filter. Furthermore, allowed users to delete and edit tasks.
